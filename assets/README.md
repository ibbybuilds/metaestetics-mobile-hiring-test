# Assets Note

## Required Images

You need to create two placeholder images for the app to run:

1. **`assets/images/logo.png`**
   - Size: 1024x1024px
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Content: Simple "MetaEstetics" logo or text
   - Used for: App icon and splash screen

2. **`assets/images/default-avatar.png`**
   - Size: 512x512px
   - Format: PNG
   - Content: Default user avatar placeholder
   - Used for: Profile picture placeholder

## Quick Solution

You can use any image editing tool or online service to create these:
- Use a simple colored square with text for logo
- Use a gray circle with user icon for avatar
- Or download placeholder images from https://placeholder.com

The app will work without these images, but you'll see missing image placeholders.
