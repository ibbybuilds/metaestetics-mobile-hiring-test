# Time Estimate Breakdown

## Realistic Time Estimates by Skill Level

### Task 1: Registration Flow
**What needs to be built:**
- 4 step components (all empty, build from scratch)
- Multi-step state management
- Form validation (Formik + Yup)
- Image picker integration
- Review screen with edit navigation
- Error handling and loading states
- State persistence between steps
- Redux integration
- AsyncStorage persistence

**Time estimates:**
- **Junior:** 6-8 hours
- **Mid-level:** 4-5 hours
- **Senior:** 3-4 hours

---

### Task 2: Profile Editing
**What needs to be built:**
- Form pre-population from Redux
- All editable fields (name, phone, DOB, gender, photo)
- Image picker with updates
- State synchronization (Redux + AsyncStorage)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Cancel functionality
- Success/error handling

**Time estimates:**
- **Junior:** 2-3 hours
- **Mid-level:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Senior:** 1 hour

---

### Task 3: Performance Optimization
**What needs to be done:**
- Diagnose performance issues
- Implement search debouncing
- Optimize re-renders (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Optimize FlatList rendering
- Add proper loading states
- Test performance improvements

**Time estimates:**
- **Junior:** 3-4 hours
- **Mid-level:** 2-3 hours
- **Senior:** 1.5-2 hours

---

### Task 4: Custom Hook
**What needs to be built:**
- Design reusable hook architecture
- Implement caching logic
- Handle loading/error/success states
- Make it generic/reusable
- Integrate with Clinics screen
- TypeScript types

**Time estimates:**
- **Junior:** 3-4 hours
- **Mid-level:** 2-3 hours
- **Senior:** 1.5-2 hours

---

### Task 5: Bug Fixes
**What needs to be done:**
- Find bugs (5+ issues)
- Understand root causes
- Fix properly
- Test fixes
- Document solutions

**Time estimates:**
- **Junior:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Mid-level:** 1 hour
- **Senior:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Total Time Estimates

### By Skill Level:

**Junior Developer:**
- Total: **15.5-21 hours**
- Realistic: **18-20 hours**
- May need more time for performance optimization

**Mid-Level Developer:**
- Total: **10.5-14 hours**
- Realistic: **12-13 hours**
- Comfortable with all tasks

**Senior Developer:**
- Total: **7.5-9.5 hours**
- Realistic: **8-9 hours**
- Can work efficiently through all tasks

---

## Recommended Time Estimate

**Current estimate: 8-10 hours**

**Should be: 10-12 hours** (for mid-level developers)

**Reasoning:**
- Registration flow alone is 4-5 hours
- Performance optimization is 2-3 hours
- Custom hook is 2-3 hours
- Profile editing is 1.5-2 hours
- Bug fixes is 1 hour
- **Total: 10.5-14 hours**

**Recommendation:**
- Update to **10-12 hours** for mid-level
- Or keep **8-10 hours** but note it's for experienced developers
- Or split into "Core tasks" (8-10 hours) and "Bonus tasks" (additional 2-3 hours)

---

## Alternative: Tiered Challenge

**Option A: Core Challenge (8-10 hours)**
- Task 1: Registration Flow
- Task 2: Profile Editing
- Task 5: Bug Fixes

**Option B: Full Challenge (12-14 hours)**
- All 5 tasks
- For senior/mid-level candidates

**Option C: Extended Challenge (15-18 hours)**
- All 5 tasks
- Additional polish and optimizations
- For candidates who want to show off

---

## Current Assessment

**8-10 hours is optimistic** for completing all 5 tasks well.

**More realistic:**
- **Minimum viable:** 8-10 hours (but rushed, may skip optimizations)
- **Well done:** 12-14 hours (proper implementation, good quality)
- **Excellent:** 15+ hours (polished, well-optimized, documented)

**Recommendation:** Update to **10-12 hours** or make performance/hook tasks optional/bonus.
